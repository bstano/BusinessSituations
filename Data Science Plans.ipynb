    "## Advertising\n",
    "\n",
    "You work at an e-commerce company that sells three goods: widgets, doodads, and fizzbangs. \n",
    "The head of advertising asks you which they should feature in their new advertising campaign. \n",
    "You have data on individual visitors' sessions (activity on a website, pageviews, and purchases), as well as whether or not those users converted from an advertisement for that session. \n",
    "You also have the cost and price information for the goods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to do here would be to interperet the data, which there are many ways to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "I might want to play it safe, and try to make an ad more likely to be successful. \n",
    "I would see how much money is made from purchases self-reported to be advertising converstions to see what ads have been successful in the past and what product most beneifts from advertising.\n",
    "From there I could look and see which products have the most sales from adverstising and make and ad for that.\n",
    "I could also see when advertising sales have boomed and line that up with a past ad and try to emulate.\n",
    "Of course, thats just if I want to play it safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "I might want to make an ad that would convert those thinking about the product but for whatever reason, unmotivated to buy.\n",
    "I could look at pageviews and purchases and see how many people lingered on the page for more than a few moments, but did not buy.\n",
    "I could see which product had the most of these such cases, and see if I could make an ad elaborating the product's benfits, or dispeling common misconceptions about the product.\n",
    "I could also see which product had the most pageviews per non-purchase, to see if any product was particularly more prone to having a conversion sale."

    "The onboarding funnel has three steps: email and password signup, plan choice, and payment. \n",
    "On a user level you have information on what steps they have completed as well as timestamps for all of those events for the past 3 years. \n",
    "You also have information on marketing spend on a weekly level.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "I would start by looking at how much time the client who did sign up spent on each step.\n",
    "If a large amount of people spend a long amount of time (compared to the task asked) on any one step, I might take a closer look at it and see if there were any problems.\n",
    "I would then look at those who did not sign up.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would find out at which step most non-customers stopped.\n",
    "If it was email and password, I might make the site more inviting to eye or better convey the benefits of our service.\n",
    "If the most frequent step was plan choice, I might better convey the options between the plans, especially if true customers spent time on it, too.\n",
    "I might also think about changing my plan options.\n",
    "If the most frequent stopping step was payment, I might consider changing the cost of my services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, I would be cross referencing all of this data with the marketing data.\n",
    "This would give me a better understanding of when it would be expected for potential sign-ups to increase or decrease.\n",
    "I could also pay closer attention to the times when advertising brought potential clients who did not buy, as the site design would be more likely to be the reson they did not."

    "I could see if there is any increase in use at any particular time.\n",
    "There could be any number of events causing mass decrease in use, a competitor, bad press, site changes, etc.\n",
